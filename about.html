                Rising Sun is a non-profit organisation that aims to provide preventive and response interventions for children who are victims of or at risk from violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation.
                Rising Sun provides a system of support, education and advocacy for sexually abused women/girls. We offer resources on
                prevention and surviving sexual abuse while providing 24hours live chat to victims of sexual abuse
                
                Thousands of girls face various forms of abuse daily and have no one to speak up for them, defend them or direct them towards help.
                We are the link between victims and those who can help; we connect victims to our various volunteer professionals or institutions willing to be of help.
                We also organise sensitisation programs on the requests made on our webpage by schools, religious bodies and camps, this sensitisation programs are geared towards educating male and female folks alike on the dangers of rape, how to avoid rape and the steps to take immediately after sexual abuse occurs.
                We regularly update our list of help hotlines and champion the cause for girls who are willing to prosecute and get justice. Feel free to contact us through the contact form or call 08023219367. for further information</p>
